# Simple-Arithmetic-Evaluator
## Purpose ##
This C program evaluates a simple (addition and subtraction only) arithmetic expression inputted by the user. If any other operators are inputted, an error will be thrown.
## Guide ##
User will be asked to input the expression they want to calculate. Spaces are handled by the program and invalid operators will throw and error, but it is assumed that the user will always enter valid numbers (integer or floating numbers). Next number and operator will be recursively read until the end of the expression is reached and the result will be displayed. At the end, user will be asked if they would like to enter more arithmetic expressions.
